# Skills Catalog

## Bundled Skills

These skills ship in the plugin bundle (`template/skills/`) and are **copied into the
project** when selected — `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Claude Code,
`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (frontmatter reduced to name+description) for
Antigravity. They are **not** installed globally: present them **individually
selectable** (one-by-one, per the **Recommend when** column), and copy each chosen one
into the project's skills dir — the same mechanism as the Workflow Commands below (the
only difference is these are picked one-by-one, not as an all-or-none group). Each
`SKILL.md` is host-neutral: it reads `CLAUDE.md` **or** `AGENTS.md`, whichever the host
uses. Log each copied one as "skill (copied)".

## Workflow Commands

A `qnew` → `qplan` → `qcode` → `qcheck` → `qgit` slash-command loop. Like bundled skills
(copied per-project, one-by-one) and unlike external skills (installed via the `skills` CLI),
these are **copied verbatim into the project** — but as an all-or-none group —
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Claude Code,
`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (frontmatter reduced to name+description) for Antigravity — so
they travel with the repo and teammates share them. Each `SKILL.md` is host-neutral: it reads
`CLAUDE.md` **or** `AGENTS.md`, whichever the host uses. Offered as one opt-in group (all five or
none), on by default in the standard/full tiers.

| --- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| W1  | `qnew`   | Load the project instructions and commit to their best practices before any work              | Always         |
| W2  | `qplan`  | Turn a task into a plan that follows the project's rules, patterns, and existing code         | Always         |
| W3  | `qcode`  | Implement the `/qplan` plan to production-ready, running the project's own quality gate       | Always         |
| W4  | `qcheck` | Skeptical senior-engineer review of the session's changes against the project's checklists    | Always         |
| W5  | `qgit`   | Quality-gate, then Conventional Commits commit + confirmed push (no AI-assistant attribution) | Always         |

## External Skills

Installed with the Vercel `skills` CLI
([vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)) from a **GitHub repo URL
plus a skill name** — never via a Claude Code marketplace/plugin install. Each row
below maps a display name to its repo and `--skill` argument.

Install (non-interactive, into the project's skills dir for the detected host), run
from the project directory. `<adapter>` = `claude-code` under Claude Code (→
`.claude/skills/`) or `antigravity-cli` under Antigravity (→ `.agents/skills/`):

```bash
bunx skills add <repo-url> --skill <skill-name> -a <adapter> -y
# example (Claude Code):
bunx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill frontend-design -a claude-code -y
# example (Antigravity):
bunx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill frontend-design -a antigravity-cli -y
```

¹ **caveman + ponytail (base skills only)** carry a mode: after a successful install
they append a short nudge block to the host doc (`CLAUDE.md` and/or `AGENTS.md`) so the
mode is discoverable — `# Communication style` for caveman, `# Build discipline` for
ponytail. The `ponytail-review`/`ponytail-audit`/`ponytail-debt` sub-tools and all other
external skills append nothing. (These two were previously in
`third-party-plugins-catalog.md`; they moved here once both shipped as skills-CLI
packages. Graphify stays a third-party plugin — it's a Python tool, not a skill.)

## Adding your own

Any GitHub repo whose skills live under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` works — add a row with
the repo URL and the `--skill` name. To discover what a repo offers:

```bash
bunx skills add <repo-url> --list
```

## Notes

- **`-a <adapter> -y`** targets the detected host's agent and runs non-interactively:
  `claude-code` (→ `.claude/skills/`) or `antigravity-cli` (→ `.agents/skills/`). Never
  hard-code `claude-code` under Antigravity — it would leak skills into `.claude/skills/`.
  Run from the project directory for a project-level install; add `-g` for a user-level
  (global) install.
- **`--skill <name>`** installs one named skill from a multi-skill repo. Omit it to be
  prompted, or use `--skill '*'` to install all skills in the repo.
- Record installed skill names in `.setup-log.json`.
